# WebChat
Create a simple web chat app using the tornado library in Python.

This project is run by doing two steps:
1) Traversing to this directory on your machine and running the command "python Webchat.py".
2) Opening a web browser and typing "http://localhost:8080/chat" into the address bar at the top of the screen.
   (A picture of how this web page should look can be found by looking at "WebChatpic.pdf" in the repository.)

Once the web page is up and running, the user is able to type a user into the "Sender" text field, and a message into the "Message"
text field. Follow this with clicking the "Submit" button and the web page will update.
